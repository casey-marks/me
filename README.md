Hi, I’m Casey! I’ve gathered the following information to serve as a brief introduction to who I am, my interests, goals and how we can effectively make the best of our time together. This does not serve as a substitute for us getting to know one another around the office. I’m open to any feedback, so if you see any discrepancies or have any suggestions, please create an issue, pull request, or let me know. This is an ever changing document.


## Passions and Interests:
I have a great passion for table tennis.* This is a great way for me to interact with others and to relieve stress. In recent years, I have also grown to love board games (such as Catan, 7 Wonders, Azul, etc.). I find that it’s a great way to bring people together and have a great time learning, getting to know each other, and for me, rarely winning.

> *Speaking of table tennis, my girlfriend wonders why I don’t just call it ping pong. My superstition leads me to believe it will make me better by using the term table tennis.

My passion for programming and technology continue to remain strong.  Everyday, I find extreme joy and interest in this field, both in and outside of work. I also enjoy helping others learn and grow in this department as I want everyone to be able to reach their best possible selves.

Some random interests of mine include watching shows about dirt (Gold Rush and Curse of Oak Island), baking (specifically pumpkin cookies), running (to offset all of the sweets that I inhale), spending quality time with loved ones and of course, my dog, Caiden.


## A Little About Me:
I really enjoy coffee, news and sports updates before I get to work in the morning. This routine jumpstarts my day by providing quality morning time.  I work well while listening to music.  My peak focus and efficiency occurs during the afternoon.  I typically take lunch around 1 or 2 pm (or after launches/meetings). I like to take my break around this time as it’s a great way for me to come back with recharged energy for the remainder of the work day.

It is worth mentioning that I have almost no vision in my right eye.  If you need to get my attention or approach me from the right side, I may be startled or it may appear that I am ignoring you (I am just unable to see that you are there).  This may take some time to remember or get used to so do not worry if you forget. If you have any questions about my eye, feel free to ask me about it.


## Growth and Goals
Working on projects that place me out of my comfort zone provide a great avenue for growth. I strive to challenge myself by adapting to change and trying new things. Recently, I’ve been putting a focus on identifying and pursuing new passion projects, application architecture (with a focus on serverless), and the latest services announced from AWS.
I look forward to future plans of creating a meaningful SAAS platform by researching, planning, and building a service that is easy to implement and useful to its customer base. 


## Meetings
Time is a precious commodity. I am fond of meetings that have a straightforward goal/purpose. When there is a clear point, it can make it much easier for everyone in the meeting to work together towards achieving the objective.  If I notice a meeting is being misdirected or going off course, I will try to ask a question to bring the topic back into focus.  Typically, I don’t speak much until I’ve had enough time to process my thoughts on the matter.


## Communication
I enjoy catching up with everyone in the morning when I get into work. For work related discussions, I tend to communicate in a very concise manner and respond well to direct information.  When I am working on a project, I tend to keep my headphones on but do not mind being interrupted if you need me.  You can do this by simply slacking me or approaching me (on my left side).  If I need to talk to you about something, I will generally approach you if your headphones aren’t on.  Otherwise, I will send you a slack or contact you by your own personal preference.

I also recognize that I have a somewhat monotone voice.  This may come off towards others as a lack of interest or being blunt.  However, I have been trying to show more enthusiasm to counteract my lack of tone range.  I am always interested in what you have to say and hope that I am able to express that properly.


## Office Hours
I hold open office hours every Wednesday for about 1-2 hours. You can use this time however you see fit. My office hour availability should be listed on my Google Calendar. I typically won’t be waiting in a meeting room, so if you want to talk just send me a message or ask me. We can meet anywhere in the building or whatever works best for you.

Here are a few questions/examples of why you may decide to meet with me:
- Have you recently run into a roadblock?
- Have a complicated issue or fear that it is becoming over complicated?
- Need a second opinion?
- Want to brainstorm OGs?
- Have any topic that you think would be beneficial to discuss?


## Providing Help
I find joy in being able to help others. I want to ensure that I am providing my best help by not picking which direction you take but rather, talking through obstacles during your journey to reaching your end goal. I believe personal gain will be better achieved by recognizing errors, trying again, asking for help and not giving up. It is my goal to help you grow personally and professionally. I want to be a resource and sounding board for you.

When it comes to providing assistance,
- **I always want you to give your best shot first.** One of the best ways to grow is to experience difficult challenges or mistakes and attempt to overcome them. The end result will always be valuable.
- **I hope you will let me know where your current mindset is and what you’ve already tried.** This is a way to provide a space to discuss the roadblocks you are facing.
- **I appreciate when you are able to describe the question or problem at hand.** If you don’t understand what the problem or issue is, I will likely have a hard time providing assistance. If I need more context or clarification, I will ask you.
- **I will commonly send reference material.** These will commonly come in the form of links, code snippets, or file names + line numbers.
- **I am available most days. If I’m not, I will let you know.** If I have my headphones on or not visibly around, send me a slack.  This will allow time for me to evaluate the question and shift into the appropriate headspace.

## Work-Life Balance & Stress Management
One thing that I strive to achieve is having a work-life balance and staying positive under stressful circumstances.  In doing so, I am able to come to work each day, happy and excited to take on any presented challenges. Without a proper work-life balance and a positive attitude, I find myself frustrated and not able to properly achieve objectives. 

Here are a few things that make sure I stay focused and mentally focused:
- I like to disconnect from work when I leave for the day. A lot of my interests help me de-stress (such as baking, running, watching tv). I am available, however, if you need to reach me or in the case of an emergency.  Please do not feel like you cannot reach out to me after hours.
- If I have areas where I am struggling, I will reach out to Dale and ask for help and hope you will do the same. It’s important to address work-life issues as they arise.
- I believe that succeeding involves failures but I will learn and grow through mistakes.  By acknowledging that I will face adversity, it eases the pressure of perfection and I am able to focus on achieving the end goal.
- When I am experiencing stress or stuck on a problem, it is helpful for me to take a step away (mentally or physically) from the issue and come back to it with a clear mind. You may see me take a walk around the office, grab a snack, or most likely playing table tennis.
